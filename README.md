## Instructions

### Installation

#### Direct download (Recommended)

- Click on link in the above table to download the deck with the specific theme.

- Download [`Dracula.apkg`](Dracula.apkg) to install all the themes in one master deck.

### Usage

1. Download the deck package
2. Open Anki and click on `Import File` (`â‹®` -> `Import` in AnkiDroid)
3. Select the downloaded file
4. The new note type(s), `THEME-NOTETYPE` should be created automatically
5. Use the note type(s) or [clone](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#adding-a-note-type) to adapt to your needs

### Update

To update to the latest version of Prettify (themes/note types), just download the required decks again.

> **Warning**: The already existing templates and styles will be _overwritten_ once you import the deck with updated content. To avoid any loss of edits, it is highly recommended that you use clones of the downloaded note types. (Refer to [Anki manual - Adding a note type](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#adding-a-note-type) for instructions on cloning a note type).
